# Predicting CA Housing Prices  
In this project, we will build Machine Learning Models to help investors and Homeowners to predict the housing prices in California based on Historical Sold Houses Data. We will run the machine learning model using the following independent parameters, Zip Code, House Age, SQFT, and Days on Market.
Motivation for the Project: Housing prices has been always hot topic, especially During the COVID-19 Pandemic. We would like to build a ML learning model to Guide Investors on Housing prices. 

## Data Source: MLS , https://pro.mlslistings.com/Account/Login.aspx

## Questions we Hope to answer:
    1. Provide Guidance for Investors on Housing prices. Will use two approaches
	  1.1  Supervised Machine learning model (Age ,SQF, Lot size & Days on the Market)
      1.2 Unsporting Machine learning model : , Zip Code, House Age, SQFT, and Days on Market.
    2. Estimate Listing price to Help homeowners and Buyers. Will run linear Regressions Model of Housing Close Prices vs. Listing prices.
