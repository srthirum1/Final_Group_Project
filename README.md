# Housing Price analysis in CA (Final_Group_Project) 

# Predicting CA Housing Prices  
In this project, we will Predict the average housing prices per SQF for each county in CA. Then we will Visualize the housing prices per county on a Map. 
We will build Machine Learning Models to help investors and homeowners assess the housing prices in California based on Housing transactions. We will build a  supervised neural network machine learning model using the following independent parameters, Zip Code, House Age, SQFT, and Days on Market.



## Data Source
1) MLS Data (https://pro.mlslistings.com/Account/Login.aspx) 
    The dataset includes 4340 records of housing sale transactions in California for the period from 9/2017 till 7/2021. The dataset includes House Address, Zip code, House size, Lot size, Year Built, Listing Date, sale Date, Listing Price, and Sale Price. 
2) Additional Data set includes the mapping of Zip Codes to County Name. . 


## Questions we Hope to answer:
Motivation, Housing prices are a hot topic, especially During the COVID-19 Pandemic (Leading to increased demand for housing). We strive to build a Machine learning model to Guide investors, Potential Buyers, or Real estate professionals on housing prices per county. 
    1. we Will Build a supervised Neural Machine learning model using  House Age, SQF, Lot size & Days on the Market to predict the median House Price per SQF for the county.
